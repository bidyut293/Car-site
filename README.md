### Component Design Principles
- **Modular Architecture**: Each component serves a specific purpose and can be reused
- **Server Components**: Leveraging Next.js 15 App Router with Server Components by default
- **Client Components**: Used only when interactivity is required (marked with 'use client')
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between layout, content, and interactive components

## üì± Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoint System
- **Mobile First**: Base styles target mobile devices (320px+)
- **Tablet**: Medium screens (768px+)
- **Desktop**: Large screens (1024px+)
- **Wide Desktop**: Extra large screens (1440px+)

### Responsive Techniques
- **Flexible Grid System**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts
- **Fluid Typography**: Responsive font sizes using clamp() and viewport units
- **Adaptive Media**: Video and image components that scale appropriately
- **Touch-Friendly**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile interactions

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Next.js Optimizations
- **App Router**: Utilizing Next.js 15 App Router for improved performance
- **Server Components**: Reducing client-side JavaScript bundle size
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting by default
- **Font Optimization**: Using `next/font` with Geist font family

### Media Optimization
- **Video Optimization**: MP4 format with appropriate compression for web delivery
- **Image Formats**: SVG for scalable graphics, PNG for detailed icons
- **Lazy Loading**: Implemented for below-the-fold content
- **Preloading**: Critical resources preloaded for faster initial page load

### Bundle Optimization
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code elimination
- **Minification**: CSS and JavaScript minification in production
- **Compression**: Gzip/Brotli compression enabled

## ‚ôø Accessibility Considerations

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and descriptions where needed
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text elements

### Media Accessibility
- **Video Controls**: Native video controls for user preference
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive alt text for all images
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Reduced Motion**: Respecting user's motion preferences
